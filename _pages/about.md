I'm Simon, a technologist / developer / maker, and this is my personal website for sharing the interesting ideas and projects I've accumulated over the years.

I'm essentially a software engineer, but I've also started up and run a few businesses too.

My passions cover a diverse range of technologies, both new and retro.

You can find some of my projects here on [GitHub](https://github.com/simondotm/)

Some things I’ve made in [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/zippycoder)

Some pictures I’ve put on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/9793651@N03/)

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simondotm) too if you want to drop me a line!
