After many years in software engineering I’ve rediscovered my old hobby of programming for the now vintage retro computers – particularly Acorn micros, BBC and Archimedes.

Since I found myself re-learning old knowledge, I thought I’d put up a site for sharing old code, new code, archives, discoveries and ideas.

You can also find my projects here on [GitHub](https://github.com/simondotm/)

Some things I’ve made in [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/zippycoder)

Some pictures I’ve put on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/9793651@N03/)

I don’t do Twitter, or Instagram. Life is too short!
